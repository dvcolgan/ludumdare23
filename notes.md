You protect the nine planets
You have a big ol bomb of some sort - maybe hurt the planets too
Aliens attacking the planets, game is over when the planets are all destroyed
weapons - 
something about gravity
waves of enemies - could have like 50 waves and then you win
or endless mode where it keeps getting harder
start at any difficulty so you don't have to wait to get into the fun parts
have all planets and the moon
grab a ship, maybe thats the only weapon
lots of particle effects for graphics squish, dust off planets

there are guns on each planet, so if you lose the planets, you lose the guns
if earth dies, you lose


punch the planet to make it go faster and smash aliens in its orbit?
how would that not be overpowered

controls:
    up is jump/accelerate forward
    down is decelerate/land on the nearest planet
    left/right is accelerate in that direction



The sun - if something falls in it, it dies
Mercury
Venus
Earth - don't smash things into it?
    the moon
Mars
asteroid belt maybe
Jupiter
    closest: io
    europa
    ganymede
    farthest: callisto
Saturn:
    Titan
Uranus:
    Maybe add its moons if there is time


All planets have gravity on you and the objects around them
smash things into the planets?


add a minimap



Story:

NARRATOR: It was a normal-sized day for the normal-sized citizens of our beloved normal-sized planet earth.

NARRATOR: Suddenly, a BIG PROBLEM appears just outside the range of all the telescopes!

CHECK IT YO -- HUGE ALIENS in HUGE SPACESHIPS! --> /\

NARRATOR: The aliens intercept all earth communications to deliver a message of DOOM:

ALIEN 1: TINY HUMANS IN YOUR TINY WORLD!  YOU SHOULD PROBABLY JUST SURRENDER!

ALIEN 2: HAHAHAHA TINY!

ALIEN 1: YOU HAVE NO HOPE OF SURVIVAL!

ALIEN 2: WE WILL CRUSH YOU LIKE TINY BUGS UNDER OUR HUGE FEET.

ALIEN 1: FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, YOU ARE NO LONGER EXISTENT!

NARRATOR: Not content with passively accepting non-existence, all earth residents pool their collective powers and let out a collective "AAAAAAAAAAH".

NARRATOR: Meanwhile, in a GIANT floating house just outside the Kuiper Belt, our hero lie sound asleep in his enormous bed.  He awakes with a start!

HERO: WHATEVER COULD THAT BE?
