You protect the nine planets
You have a big ol bomb of some sort - maybe hurt the planets too
Aliens attacking the planets, game is over when the planets are all destroyed
weapons - 
something about gravity
waves of enemies - could have like 50 waves and then you win
or endless mode where it keeps getting harder
start at any difficulty so you don't have to wait to get into the fun parts
have all planets and the moon
grab a ship, maybe thats the only weapon
lots of particle effects for graphics squish, dust off planets

there are guns on each planet, so if you lose the planets, you lose the guns
if earth dies, you lose



The sun - if something falls in it, it dies
Mercury
Venus
Earth - don't smash things into it?
    the moon
Mars
asteroid belt maybe
Jupiter
